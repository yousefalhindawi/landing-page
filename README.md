Udacity Frontend Nanodegrees - Landing Page
## An overview of the JavaScript Techniques used in this project:
* Build the navigation menu dynamically.
* Add the "active" class to a section when it is near the top of the viewport.
* Scroll to the corresponding section when a navigation link is clicked.
* Add a scroll to the top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
* Debounce.
* Throttle.
